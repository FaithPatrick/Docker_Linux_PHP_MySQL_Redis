# Introduction

Deploy Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP, Redis Server with docker compose.

I want to share my ideas and designs about Web-Deploying using Docker with you.


### Build and Run

At first, you should have had [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) installed.

Without building images one by one, you can make use of `docker-compose` and simply issue:

    $ sudo docker-compose up

For more operations to containers, please refer to:

    $ sudo docker-compose --help


__Don't remember to change MySQL Password in ```docker-compose.yml```__


Finally check out your host and have fun.
